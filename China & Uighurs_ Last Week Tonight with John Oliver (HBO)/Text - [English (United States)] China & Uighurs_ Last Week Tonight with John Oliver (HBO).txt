PLAYS) ♪

Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns eyelashes.

Among other things, the reason
that camels are so sexy.

Look without those
luscious lashes they'd just be

lumpy horses with
furry back boobs

but then you see those eyes
and remember,

"Oh yeah, I'd totally fuck
a camel."

And by the way, I'm serious,

we're gonna talk
about eyelashes.

Look, it's the summer,
there's a pandemic raging.

and frankly, I think we've
all earned a deep dive on how to

best make your eyelashes pop.
And to that end,

there's a TikTok makeup
tutorial,

that I'd like you to take
a look at.

Hi guys, so I'm gonna teach
you guys how to get long lashes.

So the first thing you need
to do is grab your lash curler,

curl your lashes obviously,
then you're going to

put them down, and use
your phone that you're using

right now to search up
what's happening in China,

how they're getting
concentration camps,

throwing innocent Muslims
in there,

separating their families
from each other--

Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.
That took quite a turn there.

She went from promising
longer lashes to

discussing concentration camps
in just 12 seconds,

and that's genuinely impressive.
Look, I'm a bit of an expert

at taking something fun,
and quickly ruining it.

So, this is game recognizing
game here.

But she is right,
a lash curler is a vital tool

in anyone's beauty arsenal
and, there's an ethnic group

in China being systematically
surveilled and imprisoned

in an attempt to essentially
wipe their culture off the map.

You know what, let's hold
the eyelash story

for another week and instead,
let's talk about this.

Because, the people in question
are the Uighurs.

They're a mostly Muslim,
ethnic minority

in a region of China called
Xinjiang.

And the Chinese government
has been treating them

absolutely terribly.

REPORTER: A U.N. panel says
 the region resembles

 a massive internment camp.

 Where more than one million
 Muslim minorities

have been rounded up, detained,
 and forcibly indoctrinated

 by the Chinese regime.

 Witness accounts,
 satellite imagery,

 and communist party documents
 reveal what appears to be

 the largest imprisonment
 of people

 on the basis of religion
 since the Holocaust.

Wow.

Saying anything is
the largest,

"since the Holocaust"

automatically makes
whatever you just said worse.

The largest collection of shoes?
Fun!

The largest collection of shoes
since the Holocaust?

Oh boy, all of a sudden,
really, really, not fun.

And if this is the first time
that you're hearing about

an estimated million people
who've been held

in detention camps, mostly
Uighurs but also Kazakhs

and other ethnic minorities,
you are not alone.

And it's probably because,
China has done it's level best

to keep this story from
getting out.

But it may be getting harder
to ignore.

Just this week, we learned
that you may actually have

a personal connection to this,
without even knowing it.

'Cause it turns out,
Uighurs are being shipped

and not always willingly,
to work in factories

across China.
And some of the products

they've been making, may be
right in front of your face.

NYT NARRATOR: If you are
 one of the millions of people

 around the world
 wearing a face mask

 because of the coronavirus
 pandemic,

 this footage may concern you.

 It shows a group of Uighurs
 arriving at a textile company

 that started producing masks
 in response to the pandemic.

 We identified several Chinese
companies that use Uighur labor

to produce PPE. And, we tracked
 some of their shipments

 to consumers in the US,
 and around the world.

Yeah, it's true. The very masks
that some in this country see

as unacceptable infringements
on their personal liberty,

may be getting made by people
who would absolutely love

for their worst infringement
to be, getting politely asked

to leave a fucking Costco.

And while there is clearly
nothing new

about horrific practices
being hidden

deep in the supply chain
of global capitalism,

what is happening to the Uighurs
is particularly appalling.

So tonight, let's talk
about them.

Who they are, what's been
happening to them, and why.

And let's start,
with a bit of context.

About eleven million Uighurs
live in Xinjiang

in the far Northwest corner
of China.

It's resource rich, and it's
strategically important.

But Uighurs, have always had
an uncomfortable relationship

with the authorities in Beijing.

They have their own language,
and are culturally

and ethnically distinct from
the rest of China's population.

Which is more than 90 percent
Han, Chinese.

On top of which, there's
the fact the Uighurs are Muslim

In a country that is
aggressively secular.

So much so, that a few years ago
a Chinese reality show

went to Dubai, and state TV
centered all depictions

of a woman in a head scarf
in the weirdest possible way.

Covering it with
a cartoon helmet

 and a shock of yellow hair
 with a ghost in it,

 and covering her hijab
 by obscuring her completely

 with a cactus in a Santa hat.
 Even doing that

 when she's reflected in
 another person's sunglasses.

And look, setting aside
the issue of religious freedom

for a second. That's
and amazing way to censor

someone out of a TV show.
I'm just saying,

watching old episodes of
 House of Cards

would be much less uncomfortable
if it looked like this instead:

Why did you ask him to leave?

Because I just wanted to look
in your eyes

one more time...

before we do this.

Francis.

We're doing this.

See?

That's just objectively
much better.

And now you can enjoy
 House of Cards,

just as much as you used to.
Which was, a bit.

So there was that base line
difference there.

On top of which,
some Han Chinese have held

bigoted views about the Uighurs.
In fact, just listen

to this interview
from back in 2008.

NARRATOR: Here in Beijing,

 Uighurs are dispersed
 across the city.

 Many work at restaurants
 and street stalls.

They stand out because of their
 different features and dress.

 Some Han Chinese are blatantly
 prejudice against them.

(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

TRANSLATOR: The people from
 Xinjiang are not very good.

 Robbers, and thieves.

Wow. Robbers and thieves.
That is not an acceptable way

to describe
an entire ethnic group.

It's barely an acceptable way
to describe all raccoons.

I mean, yeah,
they are essentially just

kleptomaniac possums,
who steal your trash

with their spooky little
doll hands,

but that's not all
that they are.

And all of this was exacerbated
by the Chinese Government

encouraging Han people
to migrate to Xinjiang

with them often being favored
over Uighurs for top jobs.

And these tensions
and resentments,

amid an overall atmosphere
of extreme discrimination

finally boiled over in 2009,
with riots in the capital

that killed 200 people,
mostly Han Chinese.

But, rather than address
the complex underlying factors

behind those riots
and other incidents,

the Chinese government
simply painted them

as religious terrorism,

beginning a decade long
crackdown

that's escalated steadily,
especially after

China's president, Xi Jinping
came to power,

and instituted what was called
the "Strike Hard Campaign,"

against violent terrorism,
in 2014.

And think of it as
the Patriot Act on steroids.

Because, all of a sudden,
Uighurs started being treated

like they were all
potential terrorists.

In fact, Xinjiang is now one of
the most heavily policed areas

in the world.

With the authorities surveilling
things that most people

would find, utterly meaningless.

If you go through
Uighur neighborhoods

 or suburbs, you see cameras

 over literally
 every house entrance,

 so the government can see
 who enters and who leaves.

How low is the bar for being
highlighted by the system?

Are you socializing more
or less with your neighbors?

Have you put gas in somebody
else's car?

Are you going out the front door
of your house

instead of the back door
of your house?

That's how low the bar is.

Oh, it goes even further.
The government has a list

of 75 behavioral indications
of religious extremism.

With some as vague as,
"people who store large amounts

of food, those who smoke
and drink

but quit doing so
quite suddenly,

and those who buy or store
equipment such as dumbbells

without obvious reasons."
Although that last one,

clearly would not be an issue
for me.

'Cause, I got two pretty obvious
reasons for dumbbell ownership

right here. It's not called
a workout,

if you don't put the work in,
brosef Bronrad.

Trust me, they call me
"The Lunch Lady,"

'cause from the hours of
eleven to one,

I don't stop stacking plates.

I call this one John,
and this one Tapper

because together,
they lift up bars.

But look, China doesn't just
collect this information

it feeds it into a predictive
policing system that monitors

that monitors for
potential threats. In one week,

it flagged the names of
24,000 people as suspicious,

15,000 of whom, were then
sent to reeducation camps.

And when pressed on whether
any of this

is strictly necessary,
Chinese officials will argue

that they are simply
being proactive.

TRANSLATOR 2: Some people,
 before they commit murder,

 already show they're capable
 of it.

 Should we wait for them
 to commit a crime,

 or prevent it from happening?

Okay, that is both insane logic
and also, the exact plot

of minority report. Which,
if you haven't seen it,

very briefly-- The year is 2054.
Tom Cruise's John Anderson

is Chief of Washington DC's
Pre-crime Police Department

where murders are stopped
before they happen.

Now ethically, there are
some questions about the system.

For instance, can you really
be sure an individual

will commit the crimes
the precogs say they'll commit?

Oh yeah, the precogs.
They are bald freaks

who sleep in an indoor
swimming pool

and they scream whenever
they visualize a future murder.

I think they're all siblings,
or aliens, or babies.

I can't remember. But basically,
the murder rate in the city

is zero, Anderson's doing well,
and so the status quo remains.

Now one day, the pre-cogs
generate a prediction.

John Anderson will murder a man
he doesn't even know

in just 36 hours. But it
couldn't be!

That's out hero, isn't it?

So, he stages an escape,
gets an eye transplant

so he can't be detected
by the cities eye-based

surveillance system,
finds out he's being framed,

then, finds out that
Max Von Sydow--

oh yeah, by the way,
he's in this too--

is gonna kill Anderson,
but decides not to

and Anderson doesn't the kill
the person that he supposedly

was going to, disproving
the very basis of

the pre-crime system,
and proving

that people do have free choice.
So, in the end,

they shut down the program
and send the precogs away

to live on a farm,
but not the death kind,

we assume. Anyway, it's scary,
but it's pretty good.

I'd say three stars.
(CHIMES PLAY)

But the bigger point is,
people in Xinjiang have been

arrested and thrown in camps,
despite having committed

no crimes. Which is chilling.
A million Uighurs were

at one point being held
extra-judicially,

many for acts as innocuous
as growing a beard,

fasting, or applying for
a passport.

And this is a very sore subject
for the Chinese government

which initially, denied
the existence of the camps

at all, before shifting
to arguing that they are merely,

vocational training facilities.
Although, even the heavily

orchestrated media tours
suggest their primary purpose

might be something else.

CNN REPORTER: Authorities
 recently took some diplomats

 and journalists
 on a carefully supervised tour

 of some of these facilities.
Some detainees told journalists

 the camps re-educate them.

TRANSLATOR 3:
 All of us found that we have
something wrong with ourselves.

 And luckily enough,
 the Communist party

 and the government
 offer this kind of school

 to us for free.

(SINGING)

Holy shit.
That might be the single

creepiest sing-along
I've ever heard

that doesn't involve Barnie.
A dinosaur who is clearly aware

of clothing, he's wearing
a hat,

and yet still actively chooses
to go bottomless

around children.

You are an absolute monster.

And for all the Chinese
governments talk

of "vocational training,"
these camps

sure seem prison-like.
Leaked classified documents

have shown that staff
at these facilities

were told to prevent students
from freely contacting

the outside world,
and that they should...

(READS PROMPT)

And the phrase,
"prevent escapes,"

is something of a tell there.
If your employee handbook says,

"prevent escape,"
you're probably working

at a prison, or at
the very least,

a Scientology picnic.

"Hey, we're just here
to grill some dogs,

play some tunes, and,
if anyone asks

where Shelly is,
do not let them escape."

And look, if that
weren't enough

to make it clear
what these camps really are,

just listen to one former
detainee describe

what she went through.

TRANSLATOR 4: Each woman gets
two minutes to go to the toilet.

 They tell you to be quick,
 quick, quick.

 If you're not quick enough,
 they shock you

 with an electric baton
 on the back of your head,

 it really hurts.
 And they did it a lot.

 Even after being shocked,
 we had to say,

 "Thank you, teacher,
we will not be late next time."

That is clearly,
absolutely appalling.

I didn't think people
had to publicly thank

abusers anymore,
now that Harvey Weinstein

doesn't go to award shows.
And look,

I'm not even getting into
the reports of forced abortions

and sterilizations
of Uighur women,

which are absolutely horrific.
And China will argue

that this is all about
economic opportunity

and attempting to assimilate
a historically ostracized

minority, but assimilation,
when forced,

is cultural erasure.
Because, in addition

to using mass detention
to keep families apart,

there are also rules
that seem to be trying

to break the chain,
by which families hand down

a culture and faith
across generations.

From laws prevents kids
from going to mosques.

To a ban on baby names
that are considered,

"too Islamic," to the creation
of state-run boarding schools

for Uighur children.

Now other moves by China
have been even more

on-the-nose,
like the destruction

of Uighur cemeteries.
The government actually...

(READS PROMPT)

And look, I'm not saying
that this

is the most important thing,
but this is one

of the pandas in question.
And frankly,

I've never had more questions.
Why is he holding a lollipop?

Why does he have the posture
of a startled gopher?

Why does he have an expression
that screams,

"I just had a lobotomy,
but it turns out

I'm both happy about it
and surprisingly horny"?

Frustratingly,
we may never know the answers.

Now thankfully, as criticism
of China's camps

has intensified
in recent years,

the government seems
to be closing some of them.

Unfortunately though,
they seem to have shifted

to staging sham trials,
and transferring Uighurs

to prisons that aren't
even pretending

to be training centers anymore.

China's also created a system
of mass labor transfers

that sent Uighurs,
and other ethnic minorities

into factory and service jobs,
sometimes hundreds,

or thousands of miles from home.

That is how those masks
that we mentioned

at the start of this piece
are getting made.

And Chinese state media
presents this as a positive.

 Showing Uighur workers
 arriving at a train station,

 then being taken on a bus
 to their new accommodations,

 all with upbeat narration
 like this.

CCTV REPORTER: Up to now,
Xinjiang has organized transfers

 for around 178,000 workers,
 providing them

 a stable employment rate
 of over 92 percent.

Yeah, you can't celebrate
a stable workforce

when it is forced labor,
any more than you'd give

me credit for spending a lot
of time with my kids

over the past few months.
Believe me,

if I had any other choice,
I wouldn't be.

Because as you've probably
guessed,

this isn't just
a benevolent jobs program,

the idea, as one local
government report puts it,

is that sending Uighurs
far from home

will allow for distancing them
from religiously extreme views,

and educating them.
And a lot of people

have been distanced.
One Australian think tank

that investigated
forced labor,

estimated that conservatively,
over just a two-year period...

(READS PROMPT)

They also found over 80
companies... (READS PROMPT)

Some of them big international
brands like Nike.

When the Washington Post
visited the factory

of one of Nike's suppliers,
it found Uighur workers...

(READS PROMPT)

With one worker saying,
(READS PROMPT)

Now, Nike has claimed
that this factory

no longer employs
Uighur workers,

and they told us...
(READS PROMPT)

Which, given what
 The Post found,

feels like their policy
on oversight

is less "just do it,"
than... (READS PROMPT)

And look, it's not just Nike.
Another company

on the list is Volkswagen,
which told us,

they found no indications
of forced labor

in their supply chain.
Though, it is worth noting,

that last year, their CEO
was challenged

about whether China's treatment
of the Uighurs gave him pause,

and this was his response.

I am, you know,
absolutely proud

to also create workplaces
in their region,

which we think is very useful.

But Xinjiang is something
you're not proud

to be associate with,
in terms of what

the Chinese government is doing
to Uighur people--

-I can't, uh, judge it, sorry.
-You can't judge it?

-No.
-But you know about it.

I don't know what--
what you're referring to.

You don't know about
China's re-education camps

for a million Uighur people,
it has been referred to

as re-education camps
as part of

it's counter-terror threat
in the west of this country.

-You don't know about that?
-I'm not aware, frankly.

Wow.
Finding out that Volkswagen

is overlooking a massive
human rights crisis

is kind of like finding out
your grandparents

are still having sex.
Sure,

it's completely horrifying,
but it really shouldn't

be too shocking
after all,

they've been doing it
since World War 2.

And look, I can understand
why companies, and others,

might want to turn away
from what's going on

in Xinjiang, because,
it's harrowing.

Remember that woman
who got electric shocks

for taking too long
in the bathroom?

She was in two different camps,
then transferred

into forced labor
at a glove factory.

All while separated
from her family for two years.

And while they were eventually
reunited,

they are understandably,
still haunted to this day.

ABC REPORTER: For two years
 you didn't see your mom?

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

That is heartbreaking,
and completely indefensible.

And whenever pressed on this,
the Chinese government

has been quick to use
whataboutism.

They responded to U.S. criticism
by invoking

a trustees (?) ranging from
the genocide of Native Americans

to a statement that read...
(READS PROMPT)

And look, those are fair hits.
Those are fair points

right there, but,
it's also completely possible

for two things to be wrong
at the same time.

And I know, the U.S. China
relationship is complicated,

particularly right now.
And too often,

it descends into reductive,
xenophobic,

us versus them stereotypes.
But human rights

should be completely
non-negotiable.

And I will say, the U.S.
has taken some small steps.

Like proposing sanctions
against top Chinese officials.

And Congress even passed
the Uighur human rights

policy act,
earlier this year.

But... Although Trump signed it,
he also reportedly

told Xi Xinping
that he should go ahead

with building the camps
because he thought it was...

(READS PROMPT)

Which, from a foreign policy
perspective,

a human rights perspective,
a political perspective,

and even an interpersonal
perspective,

is exactly the wrong
fucking thing to do.

But look,
this clearly isn't just

about Trump, is it?
Going forward,

the entire global community
needs to do more.

The U.N. should have
independent investigators

looking into what China
has done in Xinjiang.

Governments around the world
should be speaking out

about the treatment
of the Uighurs,

without bending
to China's economic influence,

and big,
multi-national companies

like Nike and VW
should not only be working

to clean up their supply chains,
but also actively using

their financial leverage
to pressure

the Chinese government
to end these abuses.

But none of that
is gonna happen

unless people pay attention.

And look, I know
that raising awareness

is often a bullshit solution
that doesn't really solve

a problem.
But there can be a real benefit

to awareness,
even if it is coming through

a TikTok makeup tutorial,
or let's say,

the exact opposite of one.

Because in this instance,
awareness is actually

a necessary precondition
for action.

And I know there is a lot
to worry about right now.

From a raging pandemic,
to an ugly

presidential election,
to a purple pervert

who couldn't give a fuck
about pants.

But... We have to make sure
that the treatment of Uighurs

is also on that list.
'Cause when you're dealing

with a concerted campaign,
centered on cultural erasure,

one of the most important
things we can do

is continue to pay attention.
At the very least,

so that if an entire culture
is replaced by a horny,

lobotomized panda,
we'll know to stand up

and fucking say something.
