00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,540
Moving on. Our main story
tonight concerns eyelashes.

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,710
Among other things, the reason
that camels are so sexy.

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,912
Look without those
luscious lashes they'd just be

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,747
lumpy horses with
furry back boobs

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,316
but then you see those eyes
and remember,

7
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,484
"Oh yeah, I'd totally fuck
a camel."

8
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:20,019
And by the way, I'm serious,

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,554
we're gonna talk
about eyelashes.

10
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,124
Look, it's the summer,
there's a pandemic raging.

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:27,192
and frankly, I think we've
all earned a deep dive on how to

12
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,895
best make your eyelashes pop.
And to that end,

13
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:31,765
there's a TikTok makeup
tutorial,

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,332
that I'd like you to take
a look at.

15
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,268
Hi guys, so I'm gonna teach
you guys how to get long lashes.

16
00:00:36,368 --> 00:00:38,437
So the first thing you need
to do is grab your lash curler,

17
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,774
curl your lashes obviously,
then you're going to

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,742
put them down, and use
your phone that you're using

19
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,278
right now to search up
what's happening in China,

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,979
how they're getting
concentration camps,

21
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,615
throwing innocent Muslims
in there,

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,383
separating their families
from each other--

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,687
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.
That took quite a turn there.

24
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,889
She went from promising
longer lashes to

25
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,092
discussing concentration camps
in just 12 seconds,

26
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:03,062
and that's genuinely impressive.
Look, I'm a bit of an expert

27
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:05,297
at taking something fun,
and quickly ruining it.

28
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,933
So, this is game recognizing
game here.

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,303
But she is right,
a lash curler is a vital tool

30
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:14,140
in anyone's beauty arsenal
and, there's an ethnic group

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,942
in China being systematically
surveilled and imprisoned

32
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,412
in an attempt to essentially
wipe their culture off the map.

33
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,482
You know what, let's hold
the eyelash story

34
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,151
for another week and instead,
let's talk about this.

35
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,653
Because, the people in question
are the Uighurs.

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,789
They're a mostly Muslim,
ethnic minority

37
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,091
in a region of China called
Xinjiang.

38
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,327
And the Chinese government
has been treating them

39
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,928
absolutely terribly.

40
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,731
REPORTER: A U.N. panel says
 the region resembles

41
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,000
 a massive internment camp.

42
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,037
 Where more than one million
 Muslim minorities

43
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:48,707
have been rounded up, detained,
 and forcibly indoctrinated

44
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,476
 by the Chinese regime.

45
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:53,479
 Witness accounts,
 satellite imagery,

46
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,383
 and communist party documents
 reveal what appears to be

47
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,652
 the largest imprisonment
 of people

48
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,489
 on the basis of religion
 since the Holocaust.

49
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,290
Wow.

50
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,292
Saying anything is
the largest,

51
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,293
"since the Holocaust"

52
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:10,029
automatically makes
whatever you just said worse.

53
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:12,331
The largest collection of shoes?
Fun!

54
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,734
The largest collection of shoes
since the Holocaust?

55
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,905
Oh boy, all of a sudden,
really, really, not fun.

56
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,307
And if this is the first time
that you're hearing about

57
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,409
an estimated million people
who've been held

58
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,112
in detention camps, mostly
Uighurs but also Kazakhs

59
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,148
and other ethnic minorities,
you are not alone.

60
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:32,018
And it's probably because,
China has done it's level best

61
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,686
to keep this story from
getting out.

62
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,755
But it may be getting harder
to ignore.

63
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,791
Just this week, we learned
that you may actually have

64
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,361
a personal connection to this,
without even knowing it.

65
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,762
'Cause it turns out,
Uighurs are being shipped

66
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,332
and not always willingly,
to work in factories

67
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,134
across China.
And some of the products

68
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,170
they've been making, may be
right in front of your face.

69
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,272
NYT NARRATOR: If you are
 one of the millions of people

70
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,707
 around the world
 wearing a face mask

71
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,476
 because of the coronavirus
 pandemic,

72
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,979
 this footage may concern you.

73
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:03,982
 It shows a group of Uighurs
 arriving at a textile company

74
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,819
 that started producing masks
 in response to the pandemic.

75
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,056
 We identified several Chinese
companies that use Uighur labor

76
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,492
to produce PPE. And, we tracked
 some of their shipments

77
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,828
 to consumers in the US,
 and around the world.

78
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,832
Yeah, it's true. The very masks
that some in this country see

79
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:22,869
as unacceptable infringements
on their personal liberty,

80
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,671
may be getting made by people
who would absolutely love

81
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,340
for their worst infringement
to be, getting politely asked

82
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,009
to leave a fucking Costco.

83
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,178
And while there is clearly
nothing new

84
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,046
about horrific practices
being hidden

85
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,449
deep in the supply chain
of global capitalism,

86
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,619
what is happening to the Uighurs
is particularly appalling.

87
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,454
So tonight, let's talk
about them.

88
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,290
Who they are, what's been
happening to them, and why.

89
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,158
And let's start,
with a bit of context.

90
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,261
About eleven million Uighurs
live in Xinjiang

91
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:52,065
in the far Northwest corner
of China.

92
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,767
It's resource rich, and it's
strategically important.

93
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,870
But Uighurs, have always had
an uncomfortable relationship

94
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,438
with the authorities in Beijing.

95
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:01,306
They have their own language,
and are culturally

96
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,309
and ethnically distinct from
the rest of China's population.

97
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,347
Which is more than 90 percent
Han, Chinese.

98
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,116
On top of which, there's
the fact the Uighurs are Muslim

99
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,518
In a country that is
aggressively secular.

100
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,554
So much so, that a few years ago
a Chinese reality show

101
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:18,925
went to Dubai, and state TV
centered all depictions

102
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:22,194
of a woman in a head scarf
in the weirdest possible way.

103
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,430
Covering it with
a cartoon helmet

104
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,366
 and a shock of yellow hair
 with a ghost in it,

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,903
 and covering her hijab
 by obscuring her completely

106
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,706
 with a cactus in a Santa hat.
 Even doing that

107
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,475
 when she's reflected in
 another person's sunglasses.

108
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,545
And look, setting aside
the issue of religious freedom

109
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,347
for a second. That's
and amazing way to censor

110
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,516
someone out of a TV show.
I'm just saying,

111
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:46,552
watching old episodes of
 House of Cards

112
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:50,123
would be much less uncomfortable
if it looked like this instead:

113
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,924
Why did you ask him to leave?

114
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,830
Because I just wanted to look
in your eyes

115
00:04:58,697 --> 00:04:59,965
one more time...

116
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,634
before we do this.

117
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,305
Francis.

118
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,306
We're doing this.

119
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:08,374
See?

120
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,776
That's just objectively
much better.

121
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,778
And now you can enjoy
 House of Cards,

122
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,681
just as much as you used to.
Which was, a bit.

123
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,317
So there was that base line
difference there.

124
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,953
On top of which,
some Han Chinese have held

125
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,689
bigoted views about the Uighurs.
In fact, just listen

126
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,958
to this interview
from back in 2008.

127
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,326
NARRATOR: Here in Beijing,

128
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,294
 Uighurs are dispersed
 across the city.

129
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,798
 Many work at restaurants
 and street stalls.

130
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,536
They stand out because of their
 different features and dress.

131
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,906
 Some Han Chinese are blatantly
 prejudice against them.

132
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:43,075
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

133
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,144
TRANSLATOR: The people from
 Xinjiang are not very good.

134
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:49,014
 Robbers, and thieves.

135
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:53,652
Wow. Robbers and thieves.
That is not an acceptable way

136
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,888
to describe
an entire ethnic group.

137
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,858
It's barely an acceptable way
to describe all raccoons.

138
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,526
I mean, yeah,
they are essentially just

139
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,562
kleptomaniac possums,
who steal your trash

140
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,962
with their spooky little
doll hands,

141
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:06,665
but that's not all
that they are.

142
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,468
And all of this was exacerbated
by the Chinese Government

143
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,171
encouraging Han people
to migrate to Xinjiang

144
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,507
with them often being favored
over Uighurs for top jobs.

145
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,243
And these tensions
and resentments,

146
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,679
amid an overall atmosphere
of extreme discrimination

147
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,517
finally boiled over in 2009,
with riots in the capital

148
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,087
that killed 200 people,
mostly Han Chinese.

149
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,023
But, rather than address
the complex underlying factors

150
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:32,658
behind those riots
and other incidents,

151
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,460
the Chinese government
simply painted them

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,794
as religious terrorism,

153
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,663
beginning a decade long
crackdown

154
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:40,299
that's escalated steadily,
especially after

155
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,735
China's president, Xi Jinping
came to power,

156
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,737
and instituted what was called
the "Strike Hard Campaign,"

157
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,241
against violent terrorism,
in 2014.

158
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,110
And think of it as
the Patriot Act on steroids.

159
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,180
Because, all of a sudden,
Uighurs started being treated

160
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,449
like they were all
potential terrorists.

161
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,885
In fact, Xinjiang is now one of
the most heavily policed areas

162
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:00,953
in the world.

163
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,188
With the authorities surveilling
things that most people

164
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,157
would find, utterly meaningless.

165
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,559
If you go through
Uighur neighborhoods

166
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,295
 or suburbs, you see cameras

167
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:11,330
 over literally
 every house entrance,

168
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,233
 so the government can see
 who enters and who leaves.

169
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,336
How low is the bar for being
highlighted by the system?

170
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,239
Are you socializing more
or less with your neighbors?

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,808
Have you put gas in somebody
else's car?

172
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:24,877
Are you going out the front door
of your house

173
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,278
instead of the back door
of your house?

174
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,180
That's how low the bar is.

175
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,417
Oh, it goes even further.
The government has a list

176
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,987
of 75 behavioral indications
of religious extremism.

177
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,756
With some as vague as,
"people who store large amounts

178
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:39,825
of food, those who smoke
and drink

179
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:42,094
but quit doing so
quite suddenly,

180
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:45,097
and those who buy or store
equipment such as dumbbells

181
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,633
without obvious reasons."
Although that last one,

182
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,468
clearly would not be an issue
for me.

183
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:53,872
'Cause, I got two pretty obvious
reasons for dumbbell ownership

184
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,075
right here. It's not called
a workout,

185
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,077
if you don't put the work in,
brosef Bronrad.

186
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,945
Trust me, they call me
"The Lunch Lady,"

187
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,580
'cause from the hours of
eleven to one,

188
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,783
I don't stop stacking plates.

189
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,018
I call this one John,
and this one Tapper

190
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,722
because together,
they lift up bars.

191
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,191
But look, China doesn't just
collect this information

192
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,761
it feeds it into a predictive
policing system that monitors

193
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,430
that monitors for
potential threats. In one week,

194
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:22,468
it flagged the names of
24,000 people as suspicious,

195
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,505
15,000 of whom, were then
sent to reeducation camps.

196
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,407
And when pressed on whether
any of this

197
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,077
is strictly necessary,
Chinese officials will argue

198
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,045
that they are simply
being proactive.

199
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,214
TRANSLATOR 2: Some people,
 before they commit murder,

200
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,717
 already show they're capable
 of it.

201
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,752
 Should we wait for them
 to commit a crime,

202
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,721
 or prevent it from happening?

203
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:48,828
Okay, that is both insane logic
and also, the exact plot

204
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,397
of minority report. Which,
if you haven't seen it,

205
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,401
very briefly-- The year is 2054.
Tom Cruise's John Anderson

206
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,836
is Chief of Washington DC's
Pre-crime Police Department

207
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,672
where murders are stopped
before they happen.

208
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,674
Now ethically, there are
some questions about the system.

209
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,776
For instance, can you really
be sure an individual

210
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,345
will commit the crimes
the precogs say they'll commit?

211
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,447
Oh yeah, the precogs.
They are bald freaks

212
00:09:08,547 --> 00:09:09,748
who sleep in an indoor
swimming pool

213
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,884
and they scream whenever
they visualize a future murder.

214
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,053
I think they're all siblings,
or aliens, or babies.

215
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,321
I can't remember. But basically,
the murder rate in the city

216
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:19,525
is zero, Anderson's doing well,
and so the status quo remains.

217
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,660
Now one day, the pre-cogs
generate a prediction.

218
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,797
John Anderson will murder a man
he doesn't even know

219
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,531
in just 36 hours. But it
couldn't be!

220
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,034
That's out hero, isn't it?

221
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,702
So, he stages an escape,
gets an eye transplant

222
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,671
so he can't be detected
by the cities eye-based

223
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,639
surveillance system,
finds out he's being framed,

224
00:09:34,906 --> 00:09:36,676
then, finds out that
Max Von Sydow--

225
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,444
oh yeah, by the way,
he's in this too--

226
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,812
is gonna kill Anderson,
but decides not to

227
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,415
and Anderson doesn't the kill
the person that he supposedly

228
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,284
was going to, disproving
the very basis of

229
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,752
the pre-crime system,
and proving

230
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,855
that people do have free choice.
So, in the end,

231
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,957
they shut down the program
and send the precogs away

232
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,126
to live on a farm,
but not the death kind,

233
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:57,263
we assume. Anyway, it's scary,
but it's pretty good.

234
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,731
I'd say three stars.
(CHIMES PLAY)

235
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,134
But the bigger point is,
people in Xinjiang have been

236
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,003
arrested and thrown in camps,
despite having committed

237
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,308
no crimes. Which is chilling.
A million Uighurs were

238
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,577
at one point being held
extra-judicially,

239
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,179
many for acts as innocuous
as growing a beard,

240
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,782
fasting, or applying for
a passport.

241
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:19,952
And this is a very sore subject
for the Chinese government

242
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,354
which initially, denied
the existence of the camps

243
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:25,123
at all, before shifting
to arguing that they are merely,

244
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:28,661
vocational training facilities.
Although, even the heavily

245
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,863
orchestrated media tours
suggest their primary purpose

246
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,466
might be something else.

247
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,034
CNN REPORTER: Authorities
 recently took some diplomats

248
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:39,171
 and journalists
 on a carefully supervised tour

249
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:42,908
 of some of these facilities.
Some detainees told journalists

250
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,644
 the camps re-educate them.

251
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,814
TRANSLATOR 3:
 All of us found that we have
something wrong with ourselves.

252
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,184
 And luckily enough,
 the Communist party

253
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,852
 and the government
 offer this kind of school

254
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:54,920
 to us for free.

256
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,531
Holy shit.
That might be the single

257
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,667
creepiest sing-along
I've ever heard

258
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,371
that doesn't involve Barnie.
A dinosaur who is clearly aware

259
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,139
of clothing, he's wearing
a hat,

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,408
and yet still actively chooses
to go bottomless

261
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,476
around children.

262
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,045
You are an absolute monster.

263
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,281
And for all the Chinese
governments talk

264
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,649
of "vocational training,"
these camps

265
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,220
sure seem prison-like.
Leaked classified documents

266
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,755
have shown that staff
at these facilities

267
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,524
were told to prevent students
from freely contacting

268
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,860
the outside world,
and that they should...

(READS PROMPT)

270
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,634
And the phrase,
"prevent escapes,"

271
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,104
is something of a tell there.
If your employee handbook says,

272
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,440
"prevent escape,"
you're probably working

273
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,074
at a prison, or at
the very least,

274
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,642
a Scientology picnic.

275
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:52,578
"Hey, we're just here
to grill some dogs,

276
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:55,714
play some tunes, and,
if anyone asks

277
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,049
where Shelly is,
do not let them escape."

278
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,152
And look, if that
weren't enough

279
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,587
to make it clear
what these camps really are,

280
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:05,224
just listen to one former
detainee describe

281
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,492
what she went through.

282
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,495
TRANSLATOR 4: Each woman gets
two minutes to go to the toilet.

283
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,066
 They tell you to be quick,
 quick, quick.

284
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,536
 If you're not quick enough,
 they shock you

285
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,772
 with an electric baton
 on the back of your head,

286
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,808
 it really hurts.
 And they did it a lot.

287
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,512
 Even after being shocked,
 we had to say,

288
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,548
 "Thank you, teacher,
we will not be late next time."

289
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:32,751
That is clearly,
absolutely appalling.

290
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:35,654
I didn't think people
had to publicly thank

291
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,556
abusers anymore,
now that Harvey Weinstein

292
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,558
doesn't go to award shows.
And look,

293
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,494
I'm not even getting into
the reports of forced abortions

294
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,964
and sterilizations
of Uighur women,

295
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,233
which are absolutely horrific.
And China will argue

296
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,569
that this is all about
economic opportunity

297
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,772
and attempting to assimilate
a historically ostracized

298
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,207
minority, but assimilation,
when forced,

299
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:59,344
is cultural erasure.
Because, in addition

300
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:01,847
to using mass detention
to keep families apart,

301
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,682
there are also rules
that seem to be trying

302
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,552
to break the chain,
by which families hand down

303
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,587
a culture and faith
across generations.

304
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,755
From laws prevents kids
from going to mosques.

305
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,958
To a ban on baby names
that are considered,

306
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,394
"too Islamic," to the creation
of state-run boarding schools

307
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,696
for Uighur children.

308
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,665
Now other moves by China
have been even more

309
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,167
on-the-nose,
like the destruction

And look, I'm not saying
that this

313
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,684
is the most important thing,
but this is one

314
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,687
of the pandas in question.
And frankly,

315
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,692
I've never had more questions.
Why is he holding a lollipop?

316
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,428
Why does he have the posture
of a startled gopher?

317
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,663
Why does he have an expression
that screams,

318
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:53,265
"I just had a lobotomy,
but it turns out

319

I'm both happy about it
and surprisingly horny"?

Frustratingly,
we may never know the answers.

321
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,007
Now thankfully, as criticism
of China's camps

322
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,608
has intensified
in recent years,

323
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,177
the government seems
to be closing some of them.

324
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,846
Unfortunately though,
they seem to have shifted

325
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,915
to staging sham trials,
and transferring Uighurs

326
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,117
to prisons that aren't
even pretending

327
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,753
to be training centers anymore.

328
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,890
China's also created a system
of mass labor transfers

329
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,392
that sent Uighurs,
and other ethnic minorities

330
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,928
into factory and service jobs,
sometimes hundreds,

331
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,197
or thousands of miles from home.

332
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,166
That is how those masks
that we mentioned

00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,068
at the start of this piece
are getting made.

334
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:33,105
And Chinese state media
presents this as a positive.

 arriving at a train station,

 for around 178,000 workers,
 providing them

340
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,224
 a stable employment rate
 of over 92 percent.

341
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,693
Yeah, you can't celebrate
a stable workforce

342
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,163
when it is forced labor,
any more than you'd give

343
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,198
me credit for spending a lot
of time with my kids

344
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:01,700
over the past few months.
Believe me,

345
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,503
if I had any other choice,
I wouldn't be.

346
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,238
Because as you've probably
guessed,

347
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,240
this isn't just
a benevolent jobs program,

348
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,709
the idea, as one local
government report puts it,

349
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,578
is that sending Uighurs
far from home

350
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,681
will allow for distancing them
from religiously extreme views,

351
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,650
and educating them.
And a lot of people

352
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,852
have been distanced.
One Australian think tank

353
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,454
that investigated
forced labor,

354
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,590
estimated that conservatively,
over just a two-year period...

(READS PROMPT)

356
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,732
They also found over 80
companies... (READS PROMPT)

357
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,139
Some of them big international
brands like Nike.

358
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,641
When the Washington Post
visited the factory

359
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:45,777
of one of Nike's suppliers,
it found Uighur workers...

00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:48,080
(READS PROMPT)

361
00:15:51,883 --> 00:15:54,887
With one worker saying,
(READS PROMPT)

362
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,190
Now, Nike has claimed
that this factory

363
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,893
no longer employs
Uighur workers,

364
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,962
and they told us...
(READS PROMPT)

365
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,202
Which, given what
 The Post found,

366
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,970
feels like their policy
on oversight

367
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,873
is less "just do it,"
than... (READS PROMPT)

368
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,012
And look, it's not just Nike.
Another company

369
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,647
on the list is Volkswagen,
which told us,

370
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,183
they found no indications
of forced labor

371
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,417
in their supply chain.
Though, it is worth noting,

372
00:16:26,517 --> 00:16:28,554
that last year, their CEO
was challenged

373
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,956
about whether China's treatment
of the Uighurs gave him pause,

374
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,624
and this was his response.

375
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,193
I am, you know,
absolutely proud

376
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:37,929
to also create workplaces
in their region,

377
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:39,631
which we think is very useful.

378
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,633
But Xinjiang is something
you're not proud

379
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,001
to be associate with,
in terms of what

380
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,637
the Chinese government is doing
to Uighur people--

381
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:48,573
-I can't, uh, judge it, sorry.
-You can't judge it?

382
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,875
-No.
-But you know about it.

383
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,944
I don't know what--
what you're referring to.

384
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,780
You don't know about
China's re-education camps

385
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,982
for a million Uighur people,
it has been referred to

386
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,551
as re-education camps
as part of

387
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,452
it's counter-terror threat
in the west of this country.

388
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,790
-You don't know about that?
-I'm not aware, frankly.

389
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,959
Wow.
Finding out that Volkswagen

390
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,328
is overlooking a massive
human rights crisis

391
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,529
is kind of like finding out
your grandparents

392
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,232
are still having sex.
Sure,

393
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:16,001
it's completely horrifying,
but it really shouldn't

394
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,502
be too shocking
after all,

395
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:20,038
they've been doing it
since World War 2.

396
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,642
And look, I can understand
why companies, and others,

397
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,710
might want to turn away
from what's going on

398
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,079
in Xinjiang, because,
it's harrowing.

399
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,348
Remember that woman
who got electric shocks

400
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:31,984
for taking too long
in the bathroom?

401
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,786
She was in two different camps,
then transferred

402
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,688
into forced labor
at a glove factory.

403
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:39,791
All while separated
from her family for two years.

404
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:41,626
And while they were eventually
reunited,

405
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,495
they are understandably,
still haunted to this day.

406
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,498
ABC REPORTER: For two years
 you didn't see your mom?

407
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,135
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

408
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,456
That is heartbreaking,
and completely indefensible.

409
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,558
And whenever pressed on this,
the Chinese government

410
00:18:13,658 --> 00:18:15,560
has been quick to use
whataboutism.

411
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,096
They responded to U.S. criticism
by invoking

412
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,465
a trustees (?) ranging from
the genocide of Native Americans

413
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:23,936
to a statement that read...
(READS PROMPT)

414
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:32,210
And look, those are fair hits.
Those are fair points

415
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,313
right there, but,
it's also completely possible

416
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:37,782
for two things to be wrong
at the same time.

417
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:40,618
And I know, the U.S. China
relationship is complicated,

418
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:42,421
particularly right now.
And too often,

419
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,956
it descends into reductive,
xenophobic,

420
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,892
us versus them stereotypes.
But human rights

421
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,462
should be completely
non-negotiable.

422
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:54,099
And I will say, the U.S.
has taken some small steps.

423
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,735
Like proposing sanctions
against top Chinese officials.

424
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,104
And Congress even passed
the Uighur human rights

425
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,839
policy act,
earlier this year.

426
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,909
But... Although Trump signed it,
he also reportedly

427
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,677
told Xi Xinping
that he should go ahead

428
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,945
with building the camps
because he thought it was...

429
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,081
(READS PROMPT)

430
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,251
Which, from a foreign policy
perspective,

431
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,920
a human rights perspective,
a political perspective,

432
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,855
and even an interpersonal
perspective,

433
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,323
is exactly the wrong
fucking thing to do.

434
00:19:19,624 --> 00:19:21,660
But look,
this clearly isn't just

435
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,761
about Trump, is it?
Going forward,

436
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,597
the entire global community
needs to do more.

437
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,700
The U.N. should have
independent investigators

438
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,601
looking into what China
has done in Xinjiang.

439
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:32,971
Governments around the world
should be speaking out

440
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,172
about the treatment
of the Uighurs,

441
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,040
without bending
to China's economic influence,

442
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,976
and big,
multi-national companies

443
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,079
like Nike and VW
should not only be working

444
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,416
to clean up their supply chains,
but also actively using

445
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,251
their financial leverage
to pressure

446
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,220
the Chinese government
to end these abuses.

447
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,620
But none of that
is gonna happen

448
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,489
unless people pay attention.

449
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:54,425
And look, I know
that raising awareness

450
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:57,729
is often a bullshit solution
that doesn't really solve

451
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,165
a problem.
But there can be a real benefit

452
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,867
to awareness,
even if it is coming through

453
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,503
a TikTok makeup tutorial,
or let's say,

454
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,239
the exact opposite of one.

455
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,575
Because in this instance,
awareness is actually

456
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:12,610
a necessary precondition
for action.

457
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,080
And I know there is a lot
to worry about right now.

458
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,082
From a raging pandemic,
to an ugly

459
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,418
presidential election,
to a purple pervert

460
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,852
who couldn't give a fuck
about pants.

461
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:24,556
But... We have to make sure
that the treatment of Uighurs

462
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,025
is also on that list.
'Cause when you're dealing

463
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:30,294
with a concerted campaign,
centered on cultural erasure,

464
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,697
one of the most important
things we can do

465
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,566
is continue to pay attention.
At the very least,

466
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,804
so that if an entire culture
is replaced by a horny,

467
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,472
lobotomized panda,
we'll know to stand up

468
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,908
and fucking say something.
